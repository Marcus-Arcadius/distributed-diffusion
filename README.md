# Distributed Diffusion
Train Stable Diffusion models across the internet with multiple peers

This repository is under heavy rework, for more information join the discord: https://discord.gg/m3EgtMryAu


Most of the code derives from WaifuDiffusion diffuser's trainer, now licensed under AGPL. This has been ported to pytorch lightning (due to issues with standard hivemind implementation) with heavy inspiration from https://github.com/Mikubill/naifu-diffusion

This project is in alpha and is under testing

## Credits:
- Haru: Wrote the first trainer and rewrote it from scratch optimizing it
- dep (me): Hivemind integration
